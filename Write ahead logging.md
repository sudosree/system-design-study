- every database system provides reliability, durability and integrity
- It achieves it using WAL
- append only logs. It's a log file on disk
- writing data to disk is complicated and it takes time
- When a machine fails what happens to the data ? 
	- when you make any update query it is first written into the WAL and then it is flushed into the disk
	- so that when a m/c loses power the data is not lost and the system can recover the data from WAL at any point of time
- Reduced disk writes
